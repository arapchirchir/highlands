                </div>
                <p>
                  Boarding life has numerous benefits, with the main one being that students’ remaining on-site allows
                  them to fully take
                  advantage of everything that Highlands education center has to offer. Each dormitory (boarding house)
                  creates an
                  atmosphere that lets
                  students feel at home and fulfill their academic potential. Teaching staff live-in and support the
                  students, overseeing
                  all their needs.</p>

                <p> Matrons, who also live in, facilitate the day-to-day domestic side of the dorms. Our dormitories
                  contain modern sanitary
                  and laundry facilities.</p>
                <p>
                  Prep time is a component of boarding life and entails pupils being supervised by a member of the
                  teaching staff as they
                  carry on with their prep (homework) each evening.</p>

                  Day scholars are as integral to our school as boarders and as such, we have a flexible approach allows
                  pupils to operate

                <p>
                  Pupils living near the school or within Eldoret town often choose to be day scholars. The school
                  provides a daily
                  transport service; picking students up from designated pick-up areas in the morning and dropping them
                  off again after
                  school hours. The school has a fleet of buses and vans for this purpose as well as for trips and
                  assignments.</p>

                <p>
                  Under the CBC system, Junior Secondary is part of middle school. Learners in middle school transit
                  from upper primary to
                  junior secondary after a national examination. Junior secondary education serves as a bridge between
                  primary and
                  secondary school for students aged 12 to 14 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All junior secondary education activities are centred on age-appropriate education, student well-being
                  and transition
                  support for students.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have rolled out a competent junior secondary school with facilities to help realization of the
                  system’s objective.</p>

                  Highlands Education centre Nursery consists of Playgroup and Kindergatten. Our children are viewed as
                  full of potential
                  with the ability to form their own understanding of the world around them. We focus on nurturing
                  creative, resilient and
                  independent learners, who are excited and confident to experiment and explore through play and active
                  learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We offer a curriculum and experience which begins in Playgroup and finishes at the end of Reception,
                  at which point the
                  children are fully prepared to transition to Junior School. This experience is underpinned by our
                  child-centered,
                  personalised learning approach that supports the development of the whole child.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our children are supported to take risks, think critically, and develop their understanding by
                  exploring through play.
                  Teachers and Teaching Assistants are seen as partners in the children’s learning journey, ensuring
                  learning is
                  continually placed in a meaningful context by engaging with the children’s interests and ideas. We
                  place great emphasis
                  on positive relationships and interactions amongst all members of our Early Years community as these
                  support our
                  holistic and inclusive approach, ensuring the focus is placed upon the development of the whole child.
                  By working
                  together, we can ensure that all early years children continue to value and enjoy their time here,
                  that they are
                  sufficiently challenged and supported in their learning, and make excellent progress in a happy and
                  caring environment.
                  We pride ourselves on our child-centered and active learning which inspires an environment that
                  supports opportunities
                  for open-ended inquiry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our warm and caring environment as well as the provision of opportunities for stimulating play-based
                  learning inspires
                  our students to be curious, inquisitive and develop awe and wonder of the world around them.
